# Level Crush

This readme will only provide a brief overview/goal/index of everything found here and link to other related projects.

## Overview

This is an excuse to just learn new technologies/ideas/concepts and get feedback with real users who actually use these services. As such, this is a "acceptable" place to make mistakes and try new things. The original code in this repository started in early 2023 and was used as an excuse to just learn the Rust programming language. Many items were just ported over from Typescript versions that were developed over the last two years and then gradually refactored as my understanding of the language of Rust improved.

So this repository is an experimental place. Not everything will stick, code is absolutely not perfect,not everything needs to make sense and its ok to reinvent the wheel for the sake of "self education" so long as it doesn't compromise/violate a user. Self Education, Experimention and Community impact/utility is the name of the game for this repository. Moving forward, this repository will do its best to store an active state of all new developments. Older developments may exist on their own repositories unless there is a clear benefit to moving it here.

## Goals

1. Develop community integrations that improve either our user or admin experiences in the games we engage with or the community we engage with.
2. Educate oneself on concepts/toolings where appropriate.
3. Make many mistakes
4. Compromise and ship working features, rather then perfection
