# Docker Setup

In this directory contains everything you need to get **started** with setting up your own nginx server and mysql server.

There are provided confs for all current services. However do be **aware** that you will need to go into these confgs yourself and modify them to match your own local ip and ports that you have the services running on. You will also need to modify your host file to include the domains provided in the conf.

A self signed cert is included just for convience. But you should ideally replace it with your own. Using these self signed certs will give you a warning when accessing these servers in a browser/code. Although there are plenty of work arounds. YMMV.
